### Isabel Repetto García-Plata

- 💻 I’m currently a tech trainee at futureproof
- and also I'm studying a Web Programming with Python and JavaScript Course at HarvardX

- 🔙👩🏽 About me...
    
    2010 - 2012 --> I was studying to be Higher Technician in Computer Network Systems Management. 
    I could not finish it due to economics problems as it was outside my hometown so I had to leave the 
    Higher Level Education Cycle (CFGS) just 4 subjects away to get the certificate.
    
    2012 - 2015 --> I decided to keep on going and I started to study a Computer Engineering Degree as 
    the Regional Government could provide me with a scholarship. There are some goals to reach to continue
    receiving that help and I did it the first two years. Sadly after my third one I had to leave it as well.
    
    2016 --> I spent the year working hard to get enough savings to come back to the university but I couldn't get enough.
    
    2017 - 2020 --> I moved to England searching for better opportunities. I've been learning and improving
    my english while working as a chef. But most of all I've been saving money to keep going with my studies.
    
    2020... --> Finally, I started to study again, and that's what I'm currently doing. 👣
    
    ### I really want to start working in tech as I am passionate about what I do
    ## IF YOU WANT IT, GO FOR IT
